Change telegram font to [Shabnam font](https://github.com/rastikerdar/shabnam-font).

## Run installer
```
$ bash install.sh
```

## Some Note
This issue is for changing terrible font of telegram. If you want to use another font, just look at `install.sh` and edit Shabnam with your font and remove Shabnam directory. Also don't forget to add your font in `~/.local/usr/share/fonts` directory.
